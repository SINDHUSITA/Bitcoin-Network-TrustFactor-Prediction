Years of interaction have shown me that ne0futur is both dull and emotional; more concerned with making himself look good than doing the right thing. Added to that he worked at MTGOX while it imploded with everyone's funds. I wouldn't trade with him. Recently he was spreading around links to a staking site offering to pay people for my location, when I complained"

This is the sort of moron early Bitcoin attracted.
